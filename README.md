Project Title: മുഖശാസ്ത്രം | Mughashastram

   
   Mughashastram is a fun, AI-powered face scanner web application that provides users with random, humorous Malayalam comments based on their facial appearance. Designed as a lighthearted entertainment tool, the app uses a webcam interface to capture the user’s face and then plays a voice comment in Malayalam that mimics traditional "face reading" or personality-based commentary, often found in Kerala’s cultural humor.

   Key Features:

    Face scan via webcam with real-time detection.

    Randomly generated Malayalam voice comments.

    Dark-themed UI with support for Malayalam script.

    Lightweight, responsive design for accessibility.
